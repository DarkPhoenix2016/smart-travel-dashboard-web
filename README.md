A comprehensive, real-time travel intelligence platform designed to empower travelers with critical safety, meteorological, and logistical data. By aggregating information from government advisories, weather services, and emergency databases, this dashboard serves as a unified "single source of truth" for international travel planning.

## 📝 Description

**What the project does:**
The Smart Travel & Safety Dashboard aggregates essential travel data—including real-time weather, government safety advisories, air quality indices, and local emergency numbers—into a single, user-friendly interface. It allows users to search for any global destination or auto-detect their current location to instantly view a comprehensive safety report.

**Who it is for:**
This tool is designed for international travelers, digital nomads, and travel planners who need reliable, up-to-date safety and logistical information without navigating multiple disconnected websites.

**Why it exists:**
In an era of global mobility, critical travel data is often fragmented across disparate sources (e.g., separate sites for weather, visas, and political warnings). This project solves that problem by centralizing this information, reducing cognitive load, and enhancing situational awareness for safer travel.
